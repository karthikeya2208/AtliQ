# AtliQ Sales Report
Hey guys, 
          This is my 1st Data Analysis project. I have made a sales report for a company named AtliQ hardware using Microsoft Excel.

AtliQ is a company that manufactures (🖱️,⌨️,🖥️,...) & sells it's products all over the globe 🌍.

Here are a few Key insights that I have extracted from these reports

🌟 AtliQ had aggressively set the targets for 2021. That tells us why the market performance hasn't up to the mark. Japan is the one that came close towards achieving the target 🎯.
